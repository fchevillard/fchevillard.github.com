<h3>Step 7 - Clustering</h3>
Clustering allows you to regroup similar molecules into a cluster (group of molecules). It can be then interesting to study the outcomes from clustering to see, as instance, within a dataset if a common chemical structure appears often. You will use ligandinfo for this procedure which is based on <a href="http://www.multid.se/genex/hs515.htm" target="_blank">complete-linkage algorithm</a>.
<br/><br/>
<li><i>Cluster</i> → <i>Normal</i> → <i>Whole Table</i></li>
<li>Set the similarity between molecules to 0.8 → <i>Normal Cluster</i></li>
<br/>
The outcomes will appears on the table. The last column (Cluster ID) gives you the ID of the cluster, so you can see which compounds are regroup in the same cluster.
<br/><br/>
<li>Are the clusters relevants ?</li>
<li>Set up the similarity</li>
<br/>
<h3>Step 8 - ADMET Prediction</h3>
A few words about ADMET...
<li><a href="http://www.organic-chemistry.org/prog/peo/" target="_blank">Properties Explorer</a> can be used to have a quick overview of the chemical properties of a molecule and his drug score.</li>
<br/>
<h3>Step 9 - Suggestion of compounds</h3>
<li>According the informations you gathered in the previous steps, suggest up to 3 compounds that could be interesting as a new drugs and explain why.</li>
<li>Verify the Bioactivity score of the suggested compounds. Do they fit for your target ?</li>
