<h3>Step 7 - Clustering</h3>
Clustering allows you to (re)group similar molecules into a cluster (group of molecules). It can then be interesting to study the results of clustering calculations in order to check, for instance, whether a common chemical structure appears frequently within a dataset. You will use ligandinfo for this procedure, which is based on the <a href="http://www.multid.se/genex/hs515.htm" target="_blank">complete-linkage algorithm</a>.
<br/><br/>
<li>Retrieve the 20 compounds obtained in <b>Part 5</b></li>
<li><i>Cluster</i> → <i>Normal</i> → <i>Whole Table</i></li>
<li>Set the similarity between molecules to 0.8 → <i>Normal Cluster</i></li>
<br/>
<p style = "background-color:#BADA55"><i><b>n.b.</b></i> The outcome will appears in the table. The last column (Cluster ID) gives you the ID of the cluster, so you can easily see which compounds have been regrouped in the same cluster.</p>
<li>Are the compounds within each cluster similar ?</li>
<li>Can you find particular features that distinguish two clusters ?</li>
<li>Repeat the previous steps and change the similarity values within the cluster.</li>
<li>Comment on the differences.</li>
<br/>
<p style="background-color:#BADA55"><i><b>n.b.</b></i> At a certain point, you might find a cluster that you like. You can explore compounds similar to the cluster members by doing another similarity search.</p>
<li>Select the compounds of the cluster in the table (they should now be highlighted in blue)</li>
<li><i>Search</i> → <i>Search in</i> → <i>Whichever Database you like</i>
<li>Set the number of similar molecules to 20 → <i>Multiple Search</i></li>
<li>Comment on the new compounds</li>
<br/>
<h3>Step 8 - ADMET Prediction</h3>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADME" target="_blank">ADMET properties</a> are very important in the drug-design process since they describe the fate of a pharmaceutical compound within an organism. Before submitting your compounds to the pharmaceutical experts, you might want to remove the compounds that are likely a "bad drug" so you don't waste the precious time of your colleagues... To do so, you will use <i>Properties Explorer</i>which gives a rapid overview of the chemical properties of a molecule and its druglikeness.</li>
<br/>
<br/>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.organic-chemistry.org/prog/peo/" target="_blank">Properties Explorer</a></li>
<li>Draw the compounds</li>
<li>What is the drug-score ? Druglikeness ?</li>
<li>Does the compound exhibit any toxicities ?</li>
<br/>
<p style="background-color:#BADA55"><i><b>n.b.</b></i> Red is a bad sign... while green is a good one !</p>
<h3>Step 9 - Suggestion of compounds</h3>
<li>According the information you gathered in the previous steps, suggest up to 3 compounds that could be interesting as a new drug and explain why.</li>
<li>Verify the Bioactivity score of the suggested compounds. Do they indeed fit for your target ?</li>
