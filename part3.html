<h3>Clustering</h3>
Clustering allows you to regroup similar molecules into a cluster (group of molecules). It can be then interesting the outcomes of a clustering, to see as instance, if a common motif appears often... We will use ligandinfo for this procedure on the dataset you obtained in the part 2.
<br/>
<li>Cluster → Normal → Whole Table</li>
<br/>
<li>Set the similarity between molecules to 0.8 → Normal Cluster</li>
<br/>
The outcomes will appears on the table. The last column (Cluster ID) gives you the ID of the cluster, so you can see which compounds are regroup in the same cluster.

<h3>ADMET Prediction</h3>
