## ADMET 
<p>data cleaning, filtering, vizualisation of chemical properties</p>
## Similarity search
<p>maybe work on the DUD dataset. For a given target look for similar compounds of the ligand within a dataset (active + decoys). If not possible to upload a dataset. Then look for similar compounds within a given database. Ideally, a comparison of several fingerprints could be interesting to emphasize the notion of chemical information within a FP</p>
## Clustering
<p>Work on 50ish ligands, cluster them to get an idea of what's going on. Is that what we expect?</p>
## Drawing
<p>Draw substructures: guess top 3 fragment that are likely to be in a drug. Code substructure in .smi. Search according this substructure. Compare to Jakub outcomes.</p>
